# Assignment 1

Building my website

### Things done correctly and things that could've be improved

I feel as though the functionality of my website is perfect. The index.html file on my homework.cs.tufts.edu redirects to my GitHub index.html. The web pages work well and the HTML files/ CSS style sheets have no errors. My GitHub has all the files with good commit messages and I think I'm starting to get the hang of Git.

One thing that I think could be improved is the styling. T spent a while playing around with the styling and trying different things, but I think after gaining more experience I will be able to use better styling on my websites. 

### Who I worked with 

I discussed the project and my webpage with Steve Bonish. We specifically talked about Git and Styling.

### Time spent

I spent approximately 3.5 hour on the project.
